1. Make dialogs wider.

2. Need a better algo for spacing. Maybe store the presentation count, figure
out from the pcount columns what a good threshold is, and use that? This means
that the threshold will be recalculated each time the question is selected.
   1. The more incorrectly a question has been answered, the more likely it is
      to be displayed next.
   2. The more frequently a question has been presented, the less likely it is
      to be displayed next.
   3. The more recently a question has been presented, the less likely it is
      to be presented next.
   4. The records must be stored sorted by presentation time ascending. The
      ptime of any record is the ptime of the record minus the ptime of the
      first record.

   // Higher = better chance of being presented.
   score = ((pcount/ccount) * 0.3)
         + ((1/pcount) * 0.3)
         + ((1/questions[0][ptime]) * 0.3);
